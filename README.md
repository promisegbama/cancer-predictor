## Cancer Type Detection Project
This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. The project is built using Python and the scikit-learn library, and is deployed as a Flask web application.

## Data
The data used in this project is the Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle using this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data?select=Cancer_Data.csv). The dataset contains 569 rows and 32 columns.

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a logistic regression classifier, trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set.

## Web Application
The Flask web application allows the user to input values for the features of a breast tumor, and returns a prediction of whether the tumor is malignant or benign. The user interface was created using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.

## Installation
To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/promisegbama/cancer-detector
- Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Flask application: python app.py
- Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000
## Credits
This project was created by Promise Gbama. The code for the machine learning model was adapted from the scikit-learn documentation, and the user interface was adapted from Bootstrap examples.
